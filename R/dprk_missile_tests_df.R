#' The CNS North Korea Missile Test Database
#'
#' The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) North Korea Missile Test Database is the first database to record flight tests of all missiles launched by North Korea capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kilograms (1102.31 pounds) a distance of at least 300 kilometers (186.4 miles). The database captures advancements in North Korea's missile program by documenting all such tests since the first one occurred in April 1984, and will be routinely updated as events warrant.
